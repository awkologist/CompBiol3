Repository for my book "Computational Biology - A Practical Introduction to Bio Data Juggling with Worked Examples", 3rd Edition, 2024

You will find more information at [SpringerNature](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031703133)

This extensively expanded 3rd edition offers a practical introduction to Bio Data Science. With a hands on-approach to learning, this book offers ample opportunity to practice:
 
- Installing and utilizing Linux as a virtual machine or remotely
- Processing bio data with the programming language AWK
- Managing data with the relational database system MariaDB
- Analyzing and visualizing data with R
- Implementing good bioinformatics practices with Jupyter Notebook and GitHub
 
This book targets students and professionals in life sciences. While aimed at beginners, it also offers valuable tips and tricks for experienced researchers dealing with large datasets.
 
Worked examples illustrate how to utilize various bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, Clustal, PLINK, IGV, SAMtools, BCFtools, Mason2, Minimap, NCBI Datasets, Velvet, Jmol, and more for:
 
- Identifying bacterial proteins potentially associated with pathogenicity
- Querying molecular structures for redox-regulated enzymes
- Mapping and assembling real or simulated sequence reads
- Identifying and mapping molecular structure mutations in viruses
- Conducting genome-wide association studies
 
All software tools and datasets mentioned are freely available. Drawing from the author's experiences and knowledge gained from both academia and industry, this book provides a practical and comprehensive approach to bioinformatics.
