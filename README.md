Repository for my book "Computational Biology", 3rd Edition

The extensively expanded 3rd edition offers a practical introduction to:

- Installing and utilizing Linux as a virtual machine or remotely
- Processing bio data with the programming language AWK
- Managing data with the relational database system MariaDB
- Analyzing and visualizing data with R
- Implementing good bioinformatics practices with Jupyter Notebook and GitHub

The book targets students and professionals in life sciences. While aimed at beginners, it also offers valuable tips and tricks for experienced researchers dealing with large datasets. The basic concept of learning by doing is emphasized throughout.

Worked examples illustrate how to utilize various bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, Clustal, PLINK, IGV, SAMtools, BCFtools, Mason2, Minimap, NCBI Datasets, Velvet, Jmol, and more for:

- Identifying bacterial proteins potentially associated with pathogenicity
- Querying molecular structures for redox-regulated enzymes
- Mapping and assembling real or simulated sequence reads
- Identifying and mapping molecular structure mutations in viruses
- Conducting genome-wide association studies

All software tools and datasets mentioned are freely available, and all code is accessible here. 

Drawing from my experiences and knowledge gained from both academia and industry, my book provides a practical and comprehensive approach to bioinformatics.
